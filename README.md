_pyrrole_ is a Role System for Python3 (3.6 and high). 
It's inspired by the roles implementation in the [Moose library of Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose::Role), 
and its main purpose is to use instead of Mixin classes and multiple inheritance.

> ATTENTION: This package is **WIP** in _alpha_ release

## Test

If you would test before install, follow these instructions:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/pyrrole.git
$ cd pyrrole
$ python -m unittest test_role.py
```

## Install

For install this package, run pip install:
```console
$ pip install --user pyrrole
```


## Simple role

Here is an example of how a role can be done:

```python
import pyrrole

class FallFromTree(metaclass=pyrrole.Role):
    pass

class Fruit:
    pass

@FallFromTree
class Apple(Fruit):
    pass

apple = Apple()

print(apple.__roles__)
```

In this example, the `Apple` class inherits from `Fruit` but not `FallFromTree`. 
`FallFromTree` is a role class that applies to classes so that they acquire the **__roles__** attribute.

## Role method

By default, all methods or attribute is inherited from a role class except the dunder methods (ex. `__str__`).. 
To force the import of a dunder or normal method, just enclose the method to inherit in a _role_method_ decorator.

```python
import pyrrole

class FallFromTree(metaclass=pyrrole.Role):
    
    @pyrrole.role_method
    def __str__(cls):
        return f"Fall from tree"

class Fruit:
    pass

@FallFromTree
class Apple(Fruit):
    pass

apple = Apple()

print(apple)
```

## More roles

An ordinary class can have multiple roles at the same time.

```python
import pyrrole

@pyrrole.role                                  # use role with decorator
class FallFromTree:
    
    def __init__(self, instance):
        self.trees = list()
        self.trees.append(instance)
    
    def fall(self, tree='tree'):
        return f"Fall from {tree}"
    
@pyrrole.role                                   # use role with decorator
class Deciduous:
    
    def __init__(self, instance):
        self.trees = list()
        self.trees.append(instance)
    
    def clean_leaf(self):
        return f"Clean all leaf"

class Fruit:
    pass

@pyrrole.apply_roles(FallFromTree, Deciduous)               # apply more role at same time
@pyrrole.rename_role_methods(clean_leaf='clean_apple_leaf') # renamed role names
class Apple(Fruit):
    def clean_leaf(self):
        return f"Clean all leaf of apple tree"

apple = Apple()

# apple has role?
pyrrole.has_role(apple, FallFromTree)   # True
pyrrole.has_role(apple, Deciduous)      # True

print(apple.__roles__)                  # ['FallFromTree', 'Deciduous']
print(apple.clean_apple_leaf())         # method renamed from the Deciduous role
print(apple.fall('apple tree'))         # method forced inherited from the FallFromTree role
```
